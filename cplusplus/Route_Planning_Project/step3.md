## render.h and render.cpp

These files from the IO2D example code take model data and render it on a map. We have modified these files slightly to include three extra methods which render the start point, end point, and path from the A* search. You wonâ€™t need to work too much with these files, but you will uncomment the code to render the results of your search at some point. Have a look at the video below for a brief overview of the file code.
