## route_model.h and route_model.cpp

These files contain class stubs which will be used to extend the Model and Node data structures from model.h and model.cpp using class inheritance. Remember that inheritance in this case will allow you to use all of the public methods and attributes of the Model and Node classes in the derived classes. You will be filling out the classes in route_model.h and route_model.cpp over the course of your project.
