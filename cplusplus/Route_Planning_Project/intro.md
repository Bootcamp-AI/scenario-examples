# The OpenStreetMap Project

In the next lessons, you will write a course project in C++ using real map data and A* search to find a path between two points, just as you might see in a desktop or mobile mapping application. The project you will will write will be using data from the [OpenStreetMap project](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).

The OpenStreetMap project is an open source, collaborative endeavor to create free, user-generated maps of every part of the world. These maps are similar to the maps you might use in Google Maps or the Apple Maps app on your phone, but they are completely generated by individuals who volunteer to perform ground surveys of their local environment.

# OpenStreetMap Data
 
OpenStreetMap data can come in several different formats. The data that is used for this project comes in the form of an OSM XML file (.osm file), and we have provided a sample from the [OpenStreetMap Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page) below. Although you may not have worked with this type of data before, have a look at the data below and try to guess which element types from the next quiz are present in the data. We are confident you can figure this out by carefully studying the data!

This project is part of [C++ Bootcamp](https://www.bootcampai.org/courses/c-developer-nanodegree-program/lesson)
