To complete this exercise:
Add the following public variables to the RouteModel::Node class:
A Node pointer parent, which is initialized to a nullptr.
A float h_value, which is initialized to the maximum possible: std::numeric_limits<float>::max().
A float g_value, which is initialized to 0.0.
A bool visited, which is initialized to false.
A vector of Node pointers named neighbors.
