## model.h and model.cpp

These files come from the IO2D example code. They are used to define the data structures and methods that read in and store OSM data. OSM data is stored in a Model class which contains nested structs for Nodes, Ways, Roads, and other OSM objects. You will be extending this class in your project. Have a look at the video below for an overview of the code in these two files.
