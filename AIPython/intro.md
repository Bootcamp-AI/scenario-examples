## Description:

In this lab you will use a created image classifier to identify dog breeds. We ask you to focus on Python and not on the actual classifier. (We will focus on building a classifier ourselves later in the program).

Your city is hosting a citywide dog show and you have volunteered to help the organizing committee with contestant registration. Every participant that registers must submit an image of their dog along with biographical information about their dog. The registration system tags the images based upon the biographical information.

Some people are planning on registering pets that arenâ€™t actual dogs

You need to use a newly developed Python classifier to make sure the participants are dogs.

## Lab Goals
Improving your programming skills using by Python to solve a complex problem.
Having fun solving a more complex problem using Python.
### **Your Tasks:**
<ul>
<li><p>Using your <strong><em><code>Python</code> skills</em></strong>, you will determine which image classification algorithm works the "<strong>best</strong>" on classifying images as "dogs" or "<strong>not</strong> dogs".</p></li>
<li><p>Additionally, you want to determine how well the "<strong>best</strong>" classification algorithm works on correctly identifying a dog's breed.  Fortunately, the registration system will tag each photo with the registered dog's breed (as entered by the participant).  Your program will <em>only</em> need to compare the photo's filename (which will include the breed) to the breed that the classification algorithm returns. For images where the breed differs, other volunteers will call and verify a dog's breed.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally with computational tasks, there is often a trade-off between accuracy and runtime. The more accurate an algorithm, the higher the likelihood that it will take more time and use more computational resources to run. To better prepare you for discussing this and exploring the "best" option when solving a problem computationally, we would like you to time how long each algorithm takes to solve the classification problem. </p></li>
