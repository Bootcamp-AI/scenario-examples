## TODO: Edit program check_images.py

The check_images.py is the program file that you will be editing to achieve the four objectives above. This file contains a main() function that outlines how to complete this program through using functions that have not yet been defined. You will be creating these undefined functions in check_images.py to achieve the objectives above.

### For students that:
<ul>
<li>Have less time to devote to the lab,</li>
<li>Are new to Python and/or programming, or</li>
<li>Feel less comfortable with programming in Python.</li>
</ul>
We have provided an alternative version of ***check_images.py** named **check_images_hints.py***. It's the same as check_images.py, except check_images_hints.py:

<ul>
<li>Provides more of the instructor solution, so there is less for the student to code on their own. </li>
<li>Provides detailed directions on the sections that the student is expected to code on their own.  </li>
</ul>

Both check_images.py and check_images_hints.py will reach the same solution, so the solutions videos at the end of each section apply to both. It is left for the student to decide which version of the lab (check_images.py or check_images_hints.py) that they want to complete. Please note that when we refer to check_images.py in 6. Timing Code through 15. Printing Results we are referring to check_images.py OR check_images_hints.py which ever program you decided to edit for this lab.

## Note that:
Before beginning the lab please review the Frequently Asked Questions, FAQ, about the lab. This FAQ covers questions that frequently appeared in Slack for AIPND.

<li><p>Before beginning the lab please review the <a href="https://github.com/udacity/AIPND/blob/master/notes/lab_intro-to-python-lab.md" target="_blank">Frequently Asked Questions</a>, FAQ, about the lab. This FAQ covers questions that <em>frequently</em> appeared in <em>Slack</em> for AIPND. </p></li>
<li><p>If a students decides to complete the more challenging version of the lab (<strong>check_images.py</strong>); they are encouraged to look at <strong>check_images_hints.py</strong> for <strong><em>hints</em></strong> if they get stuck completing part of the lab.</p></li>
<li><p>This lab and other lessons within the Nanodegree will be using a GitHub repository to store program files and other resources for this Nanodegree. To learn more about GitHub, please see the <strong>GitHub</strong> Lesson that's located within the <strong>Extracurricular</strong> section of this Nanodegree.  This <em>optional</em> material is provided to give students more information on how to use GitHub for those that are less familiar with GitHub.   </p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Lab Workspace</strong> concept is setup with the programs and files (like pet_images folder) you will need to complete the lab. It is recommended that you only edit and change the <strong>check_images.py</strong>(or <strong>check_images_hints.py</strong>) program to complete the lab.  Changes to other files and programs within this Workspace can result in your program not running appropriately even if you have coded it correctly.</li></ul></li>
<li><p>The Python comments that begin with <strong><em><code># TODO:</code></em></strong> in <strong>check_images.py</strong>(or <strong>check_images_hints.py</strong>) program indicates where you will need to change the code of the program.  The comments in <strong>check_images.py</strong>(or <strong>check_images_hints.py</strong>) will help you make changes so that your program will achieve the principle objectives above.</p></li>
<li><p>Function docstrings contain input <strong><em>parameters</em></strong> and <strong><em>return values</em></strong>, which were left to provide guidance for achieving the instructor provided solution using <strong>check_images.py</strong>. These serve as helpful guidance, you are welcome to program these functions differently as long as you achieve the objectives above. If you decided to edit <strong>check_images_hints.py</strong> instead of <strong>check_images.py</strong>, you will have to use the variable, argument, and parameter names within the <strong>check_images_hints.py</strong> program.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>6. Timing Code</strong> to <strong>15. Printing Results</strong> will provide additional guidance for programming the <em>undefined</em> functions and completing the <strong>check_images.py</strong>(or <strong>check_images_hints.py</strong>) program. This information has been provided to you to help you complete the lab more quickly.  <br>
Specifically the information provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which <strong>Lessons</strong> to review regarding programming the <em>undefined</em> functions.</li>
<li>Details about the assignment's files (e.g. image files in pet_images folder, dognames.txt).</li>
<li>Details regarding using the <em>classifier function</em> in <strong>classifier.py</strong>.</li>
<li>Links to relevant python documentation.</li>
<li>Relevant <em>example code</em> (see "<strong>Example Code</strong>" section below). </li></ul></li>
<li><p>Students can use the functions within the program <a href="https://github.com/udacity/AIPND/blob/master/intropylab-classifying-images/print_functions_for_lab_checks.py" target="_blank">print_functions_for_lab_checks.py</a> to check their code for sections <strong>7. Command Line Arguments</strong> through <strong>14. Calculating Results</strong>. Students will find this program within the Lab Workspace and within the GitHub repository (see link above). The docstring below each function definition within <strong>print_functions_for_lab_checks.py</strong>, describes how to use the function.  Additionally, one can find each function used within the <em>Lab Solution</em> (see below).</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Lab Solution</em> can be found within <strong>18. Lab Solution Workspace</strong> and within the GitHub repository as <a href="https://github.com/udacity/AIPND/blob/master/intropylab-classifying-images/check_images_solution.py" target="_blank">check_images_solution.py</a>.</p></li>
